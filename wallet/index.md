# Integrate your dapp with MetaMask

Integrate your dapp with the MetaMask wallet to enable users to connect their MetaMask wallet from: 

- Desktop and mobile browsers. 
- Desktop and mobile applications.
- Games built on platforms such as Unity. 

Integrating your dapp with the MetaMask wallet takes only two lines of code and enables: 

- Connecting your application to millions of MetaMask users.
- Access to all chains supported by MetaMask. 

The methods for integrating the MetaMask wallet into your dapp are: 

- [MetaMask SDK](how-to/use-sdk/index.md). The MetaMask SDK is the recommended way to connect dapps 
to the MetaMask wallet.
The MetaMask SDK provides a reliable, secure, and seamless [connection](concepts/sdk-connections.md)
from your dapp to the MetaMask browser extension and MetaMask Mobile.
- [MetaMask Ethereum provider API](reference/provider-api.md). The Ethereum provider API is 
a JavaScript API that MetaMask injects into websites visited by MetaMask users.The Ethererum provider
API can request users' Ethereum accounts, read data from blockchains the user is connected to, 
and suggest that the user sign messages and transactions.

Get started by [setting up your development environment](get-started/set-up-dev-environment.md).
